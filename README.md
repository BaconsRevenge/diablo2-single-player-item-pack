# Diablo II Single Player Item Pack
A repository of Diablo 2 single player item files. These are usable with a save editor of sorts (there are plenty around) and are intended to be used for testing out builds and different gear combinations

This is a reupload of _"Kingpint'z Item Pack"_. I have had this lying around for years because of _"legit"_ PvP dueling on Open Battle.Net. Honestly just putting it here so that I don't lose it, and I know that the Single Player community is/was pretty active, so it's nice to have access to some things we don't have access to (torch).

Here are the original text files... I am not sure if the instructions are still correct since they are years old. But I will get around to revising these for the `1.14` patch as well as adding more items that are missing.

> ## How to Use Kingpint'z Item Pack:
Step 1: You have to download "Hero Editor (HE) 0.95"
Download it from Trusted Sites like (used to be ladderhall)

>Step 2: Install the HE

>Step 3: Start HE and Load Char (or klick on Extras and look left, to creat new Char)

>Step 4: Klick on Inventory. Now Right-Klick on the Inventory-Fence.

>Step 5: Klick on Load Item. Now search for the Item you want.

>Step 6: Klick on Save. Now the Char you selected has got this Item.

>Have Fun!
